# Workattech task

My submission for the assigned task. Kindly keep a few things in mind:

1. Pixel size in figma and browsers may not match. Therefore, while I have used the exact same pixel size as mentioned in the figma file, the end result might look different.
1. Some pages were incomplete in figma file (like the mobile version of the profile page) so I designed them the way I found suitable.
1. Not all necessary stuff was redlined in the figma file (like footer height on mobile, or font size various times), so I used my own values.
1. There was no procedure mentioned to delete a developer from the frontend. So, it can only be done by making an API request.

## Tools used
